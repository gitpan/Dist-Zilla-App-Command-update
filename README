NAME
    Dist::Zilla::App::Command::update - A Dist::Zilla (and hence
    Dist::Milla) command to update generated files

SYNOPSIS
        $ dzil update
        $ milla update    # my use case

DESCRIPTION
    This command is approximated by

        $ dzil build --no-tgz
        $ rm -rf Your-Package-x.yz/

    but it builds inside a temporary directory. If you've ever used "dzil
    build && dzil clean" to update generated files, now you can use "dzil
    update". That's all!
